## Overview

This document contains consolidated engineering standards and guidelines that all agents must follow. These standards are synthesized from the following APM packages:

- `EmeaAppGbb/spec2cloud-guidelines` - General engineering principles
- `EmeaAppGbb/spec2cloud-guidelines-backend` - Backend development standards
- `EmeaAppGbb/spec2cloud-guidelines-frontend` - Frontend development standards

## General Principles

### Code Quality
- Write clean, readable, self-documenting code
- Follow SOLID principles
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Testing
- Minimum test coverage: 85%
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Documentation
- Document public APIs
- Include code comments for complex logic
- Keep README files up to date
- Use MkDocs for project documentation

### Security
- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

## Backend Standards

### .NET Core Guidelines
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Implement dependency injection
- Use MediatR for CQRS pattern
- Follow REST API conventions

### Database
- Use Entity Framework Core for data access
- Implement repository pattern
- Use migrations for schema changes
- Optimize queries for performance

### API Design
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger for documentation
- Implement versioning (v1, v2)
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Use consistent error response format

## Frontend Standards

### Next.js/React Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper state management
- Follow component composition patterns
- Optimize for performance (lazy loading, memoization)

### TypeScript
- Enable strict mode
- Define proper types for all data
- Avoid `any` type
- Use interfaces for object shapes

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain consistent design system
- Use CSS modules for component-specific styles

## File Patterns

These guidelines apply based on file patterns:

| Pattern | Guidelines Applied |
|---------|-------------------|
| `*.cs` | .NET Core, C# coding standards |
| `*.tsx`, `*.ts` | TypeScript, React standards |
| `*.test.*` | Testing standards |
| `*.md` | Documentation standards |
