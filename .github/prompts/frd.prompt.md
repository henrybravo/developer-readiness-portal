# Break PRD into Feature Requirements Documents (FRDs)

Break down the PRD into focused Feature Requirements Documents using the **#frd-generation** skill.

## Task

Decompose the high-level PRD into individual, independently implementable features documented in `specs/features/*.md`.

## Skill Reference

Use **#frd-generation** skill for:
- FRD template and format
- Feature decomposition methodology
- Traceability between PRD and FRDs
- Acceptance criteria definition

## Expected Outcome

Individual FRD files in `specs/features/` (e.g., `user-authentication.md`, `booking-calendar.md`) that define WHAT each feature should achieve.
