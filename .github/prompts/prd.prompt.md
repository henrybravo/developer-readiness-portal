# Create Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document using the **#prd-generation** skill.

## Task

Translate the user's product idea or stakeholder input into a structured PRD in `specs/prd.md`.

## Skill Reference

Use **#prd-generation** skill for:
- PRD template and format
- Discovery questions and requirements gathering methodology
- Best practices for WHAT vs HOW separation
- Examples and quality criteria

## Expected Outcome

A complete PRD in `specs/prd.md` that defines WHAT needs to be built (not HOW to build it).
